2024-06-05 19:27:24,983 - DEBUG - Response received: Of course! I'd be happy to help. To get started, could you please tell me a little bit more about your needs? Here are some questions to consider:

1. What is your skill level? Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced rider?
2. What type of riding will you be doing most - off-road (mountain bike), commuting in the city, racing (road bike), or a little bit of everything (hybrid bike)?
3. Do you have a preference for men's or women's bikes, or does it not matter?
4. What is your height? Since bicycles come in different sizes, this helps in finding a bike that would fit you comfortably.
5. Is there a particular budget range you wish to stick to?

Feel free to answer all or some of these questions; they'll help us narrow down your options.
